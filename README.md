# Mining_Equipment_Effciencies
Hello, 

This is the code and the end result of the data cleanup from the scrape.
This project is still currently being worked on. 

Goals for this project:
1. To learn more about the Google Cloud Platform, Google Sheets API, and Google Drive API.
2. To automate the process of importing my data into Google Sheets.
3. To automate the process of formatting my data in Google Sheets.
4. To gather more data for other mining equipment and for improving the current (GPU Efficiencies) sheet. 

Here is the data in Google Sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HWsU_Res9zf6dKOMAwBBYzYXqNYjMD0M7nXxYF-Ctdg/edit?usp=sharing
